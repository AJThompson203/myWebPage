            <p>I am a computer science student that has a passsion for building web based applications using CSS and
                JavaScript.
                <br><br>
                As a programming student I have made it a goal of mine to explore other programming languages that are
                outside <br>
                of my comfort zone in order to both expand my abilities as a developer and also create a better
                understanding of the <br> potential careers and projects that I can reach out to in the future. Some
                of the programs I plan to endevor are C# <br> & C++ and
                Python. As well as expand my abilities with JavaScript by utilizing API's, Node.JS, & React.
